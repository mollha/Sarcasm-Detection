<STARS>5.0</STARS> <TITLE>A Must For Any Collection.</TITLE> <DATE>November 20, 2001</DATE> <AUTHOR>"dmbrocks"</AUTHOR> <PRODUCT>Either / Or (Audio CD)</PRODUCT> <REVIEW> First, this album is a work of genius. Second, here is why you should buy it.  ampersand! quot;Either/Or ampersand! quot; is Elliot's 3rd solo release, following 3 albums and several EPs with the Portland indie/grunge band Heatmiser. I can't speak for  ampersand! quot;roman candle ampersand! quot; or  ampersand! quot;Elliot Smith, ampersand! quot; but i can tell you about this album...which is one of the best i have ever heard.  As several other reviews said, this album has an ethereal, acoustic sound, best compared to Simon and Garfunkel or Nick Drake. The songs - short, but beautiful - are vintage Elliot, with moody, depressing lyrics generally about the girl who got away - and why it's his own fault.  ampersand! quot;Nobody broke your heart...you broke your own cuz you can't finish what you start, ampersand! quot; he chants over and over on  ampersand! quot;Alameda. ampersand! quot; Elliot utilizes both complex, Dylanesque lines along with simple, powerful phrases like the chorus of  ampersand! quot;Ballad of Big Nothing ampersand! quot; to create truly moving songs...and if that's not enough, Elliot is a fine singer.  The highlight of many songs is the vocal melody, especially on the bright  ampersand! quot;Rose Parade. ampersand! quot; Elliot's trademarke guitar work is here, of course - his pick/strum chord-oriented songs comprise the bulk of the album. The music stands on it's own, yet creates a suberb backing for Elliot's singing and lyrics. This is one of his best albums, and i would consider it stronger than XO, which has been more universally acclaimed (even by this website!). A few standout tracks - of course, the songs from Good Will Hunting...  ampersand! quot;Ballad of Big Nothing ampersand! quot;  ampersand! quot;Say Yes ampersand! quot; and  ampersand! quot;Between the Bars. ampersand! quot; The entire album is great, however, with not a single weak track.  You should pick this one up - everyone should give  ampersand! quot;Either/Or ampersand! quot; a chance, because someday it will stand as one of the finest albums produced during the 1990's...and maybe ever. </REVIEW>
