<STARS>5.0</STARS> <TITLE>Simply the best</TITLE> <DATE>October 20, 2001</DATE> <AUTHOR>Wheelchair Assassin</AUTHOR> <PRODUCT>Superunknown (Audio CD)</PRODUCT> <REVIEW> I've listened to lots of music, and  ampersand! quot;Superunknown ampersand! quot; doubtlessly stands as arguably the best album I have ever heard.  Visionary, perfectly executed and technically impeccable, Soundgarden set the standard for dark hard rock with this one.  I can't really think of a place to start in praising this album, but Chris Cornell's vocals are as good a place as any.  From the hushed tones of  ampersand! quot;Fell on Black Days ampersand! quot; to the cathartic wailing of tunes like  ampersand! quot;My Wave ampersand! quot; and the propulsive singing of  ampersand! quot;Fourth of July, ampersand! quot; Cornell can simply do it all.  His dark, churning, guitar riffs, aided by Kim Thayil's soaring, distorted solos, complete the powerful atmosphere of these songs.  Add in Matt Cameron's nimble and inventive drumwork and the result is a musical masterpiece.  The variety of this album is also noteworthy, as it mixes hard rockers like the opening double shot of  ampersand! quot;Let Me Drown ampersand! quot; and  ampersand! quot;My Wave ampersand! quot; with slower, more melodic numbers like the hits  ampersand! quot;Fell on Black Days ampersand! quot; and  ampersand! quot;The Day I Tried To Live. ampersand! quot;  The megahit  ampersand! quot;Black Hole Sun, ampersand! quot; while a strong song, is easily the worst track on the album, with the exception of the filler track  ampersand! quot;Half. ampersand! quot;   ampersand! quot;Superunknown ampersand! quot; boasts all that serious music fans could possibly want, from creativity to technical precision to complex arrangements to a truly masterful and powerful overall vocal performance from Chris Cornell.  A masterpiece in every sense of the word. </REVIEW>
