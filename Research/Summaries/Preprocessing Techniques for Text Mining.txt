STOP WORD REMOVAL
- stop words are words such as in, an, the, with, etc that don't provide any additional context or meaning to text
- we don't want to consider them as keywords or tokens for this reason
Hassan Saif [1] investigated whether or not removing stop words helps or hampers twitter sentiment classification methods
- Results are such that using pre-compiled lists of stop words negatively impacts the performance
- However, dynamic generation of stop words lists can be quite effective, removing those words that are infrequently
appearing (once appearance) in the corpus appears to be the optimal method for maintaining a high classification
 performance while reducing the data sparsity and substantially shrinking the feature space.
