Aim is to extract the useful information from a large amount of data

STOP WORD REMOVAL - data pre-processing stage
- stop words are words such as in, an, the, with, etc that don't provide any additional context or meaning to text
- we don't want to consider them as keywords or tokens for this reason
Hassan Saif [1] investigated whether or not removing stop words helps or hampers twitter sentiment classification methods
- Results are such that using pre-compiled lists of stop words negatively impacts the performance
- However, dynamic generation of stop words lists can be quite effective, removing those words that are infrequently
appearing (once appearance) in the corpus appears to be the optimal method for maintaining a high classification
 performance while reducing the data sparsity and substantially shrinking the feature space.

STEMMING
- identifying the root / stem of a word can help us to reduce the number of words
- usually considered as a recall enhancing mechanism (i.e. increasing the proportion of true positives to false negatives)
- there are generally 3 categories of stemming algorithms
1. truncating (removing the suffixes or prefixes of words - i.e. affixes)
2. statistical (based on statistical techniques, most remove affixes after implementing some statistical procedure)
3. mixed (requires a very large corpus)

For example, the words connect, connected, connecting and connections can all be stemmed to the same word - connect
