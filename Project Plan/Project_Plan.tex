\noindent \textbf{Project title:} An analysis of machine learning and deep learning techniques for the detection of sarcasm in text

\section{Outline}
\subsection{Project Description}
\noindent Numerous studies have looked at machine learning, and more recently, deep learning  techniques for sarcasm detection in text corpora. With applications in areas such as opinion mining and sentiment analysis, it has become a popular field of research. The aim of \textit{this} project is to understand how various pre-processing, word-embedding and text classification techniques affect performance on this task, in order to produce a tool that can detect sarcasm with a \textit{high degree} of accuracy.\\

\subsection{Preliminary Preparations}
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{0em}
	\item Collect and evaluate a selection of datasets
	\item Produce a literature survey documenting previous research in the domain of sarcasm detection and other text classification tasks
	\item Identify state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques
	\item Gain a high-level overview of the following python libraries: NLTK, scikit-learn, spaCy, PyTorch and TensorFlow (including the deep learning library Keras)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Research Questions}
The research questions for this project are as follows:-
\begin{itemize}
	\setlength\itemsep{0em}
	\item How do machine learning approaches compare to deep learning techniques for sarcasm detection?
	\item Is it possible to detect the words that correlate more to certain labels?
	\item How does the solution perform on other datasets?
\end{itemize}
