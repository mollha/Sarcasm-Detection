Basic
Select a high-quality dataset
Clean and segment data appropriately
Discuss the different forms of sarcasm and the difficulty of detecting them





Intermediate

Implement a model that is currently deemed to be state-of-the-art
Produce a final model using the best approach as determined by the results of former tasks
Analyse the effectiveness of the model when applied to various other forms of social media data (e.g. twitter data, online reviews - not JUST Reddit posts)

How can combining a model with different features affect the performance of a model (e.g. how many followers does the author of a sarcastic tweet have on twitter)





Advanced Deliverables
Incorporate contextual embeddings (i.e. ELMo and BERT)
Identify the indicator of sarcasm
Create my own high-quality dataset, encoporating features of other successful datasets
Create a GUI that enables the user to interact with the finished tool

Create a model that improves upon the performance of a trivial sentiment analyzer
More often than not, sarcasm is negative disguised as positive. By introducing a third category, sarcastic, into sentiment analysis, can we improve the results of the state of the art
i.e. See if the chosen technique can improve the performance of a sentiment analyzer



Evalute the performance of a deep-learning model from another domain on sarcasm detection
